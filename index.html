    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Yaman Alkın — an analytical thinker, data enthusiast, and business-minded extrovert with a passion for exploring how technology, numbers, and people come together to create real-world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing my studies in the CLABE (Business and Economics) program at the University of Bologna, where I’m building a solid foundation in economics, business, and quantitative methods. My academic journey fuels my passion for data science and helps me connect theoretical knowledge with practical, data-driven problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in the intersection of computer science and statistics — where raw data transforms into meaningful insights that drive smarter decisions. I enjoy identifying patterns, solving complex problems, and asking the right questions to improve outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being an extrovert, I excel at communicating ideas clearly and working effectively with people from all backgrounds. I believe that strong analytical skills paired with strong communication is what creates real value in any project or team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I actively follow the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, always looking for ways to apply new technologies and stay ahead of the curve. Whether it’s through hands-on projects, research, or experimenting with new tools, I make it a point to keep learning and adapting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond STEM, I have a deep passion for personal development and exploring non-technical fields like psychology, philosophy, and history. These interests shape the way I think, work, and grow as a person and professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the core of everything I do is a mindset that constantly asks: “Can I make this better?” I’m driven by experience, fueled by curiosity, and motivated by the pursuit of excellence. I believe in putting in the work, learning from every challenge, and pushing forward until I achieve the best possible outcome.
    </p>
    <p><em>Thanks for visiting — I’m excited about what’s ahead, and I’m just getting started.</em></p>
